# Twitter-Recent-Search
## Objective: 
### Grabs tweets related to power and internet outages from certain companies in Ontario

## Background:

Had to conduct an exploratory analysis on the Twitter API and see what type of power and internet outage information could be obtained from twitter. Need a free developer account with twitter to get the token to access the Twitter API. It sends a HTTP GET request and the json response returned is formatted and converted into a excel file with details. The next step would be to conduct a sentiment analysis or use natural language processing which this doesn't do. It simply was an excerise to see what type of information is available and how we can organize it to give us information on user location and current power outage information.
